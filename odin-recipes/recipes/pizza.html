    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p> A wholesome recipe for the juicest Pizza you have ever had.</p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li> 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li> 1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> 3 1/3 cups all purpose flour </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>

    <ol> 
        <li> In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and brown sugar in the water, and let sit for 10 minutes. </li>
        <li> Stir the salt and oil into the yeast solution. Mix in 2 1/2 cups of the flour.</li>
        <li> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). If you are baking the dough on a pizza stone, you may place your toppings on the dough, and bake immediately. If you are baking your pizza in a pan, lightly oil the pan, and let the dough rise for 15 or 20 minutes before topping and baking it.</li>
        <li> Bake pizza in preheated oven, until the cheese and crust are golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
